It draws the most ideal combination of green building technologies that satisfies the architecture’s overall objective of environmental quality level, schedule, economic feasibility that has its base on BIM.\nEco-friendly high-tech construction materials : The main purpose is to develop recyclable building materials that can replace various types of construction materials(cement, tile, block ect.) by analysis and utilization of base materials of wastes as a result of construction industry. The main field of study is DB establishment of construction raw materials waste through the through the classification and chemical analysis of construction waste, research of establishing sustainable construction material development process using waste construction materials and utilizing these for the research on establishing the guideline of complete sustainable circulation of construction materials.\nPapers\n“Assessment of the CO2 emission and cost reduction performance of a low-carbon-emission concrete mix design using an optimal mix design system”, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2013\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211300316X\n\"Development of an optimum design program (SUSB-OPTIMUM) for the life cycle CO2 assessment of an apartment house in Korea\", Building and Environment, 2014\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132313003351\n\"Development of building materials embodied greenhouse gases assessment criteria and system (BEGAS) in the newly revised Korea Green Building Certification System (G-SEED)\", Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2014\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114002615\n\"Development of a Building Life Cycle Carbon Emissions Assessment Program (BEGAS 2.0) for Korea's Green Building Index Certification System\", Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2016\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115010187\n\"Proposal of Environmental Impact Assessment Method for Concrete in South Korea: An Application in LCA (Life Cycle Assessment)\", International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 2016\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/13/11/1074\n\"Mixture Proportioning Approach for Low-CO2 Concrete Using Supplementary Cementitious Materials\", ACI Materials Journal, 2016\nhttps://search.proquest.com/docview/1809938086?pq-origsite=gscholar\n\"Evaluating the embodied environmental impacts of major building tasks and materials of apartment buildings in Korea\", Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2017\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117300916\n\"Energy Demand Forecast Models for Commercial Buildings in South Korea\", Energies, 2019\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/12/2313\nWritings\nHandbook of Low Carbon Concrete, 1st Edition (2016, Butterworth –Heinemann)\nhttps://www.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-low-carbon-concrete/nazari/978-0-12-804524-4\nPatents\nSystem for Assessing an Environmental Load of Building during Life Cycle\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US8645183B2/en?oq=8%2c645%2c183\nContact Information\n연구실 URL :\nhttp://subest.hanyang.ac.kr/\n친환경건축기술연구소 :\nhttp://susb.hanyang.ac.kr/\nE-mail : jnb55@hanyang.ac.kr"
