  "content": "Nano Process and Device Laboratory (NPDL) is a research group led by professor Jinho Ahn. NPDL was established in 1995 within the Department of Material Science and Engineering at Hanyang University. Our group actively explores nano-processes and devices. Nano-patterning technologies including EUV Lithography and thin film process are the major research fields. 3D printing technologies and the new functional materials for 3D printing are also our new concems\n소속: 서울\n공과대학\n신소재공학부\n영문명: Nano Process and Device Laboratory\n실장:\n안진호\n신소재공학부\n교수\n홈페이지:\nhttp://msenano.hanyang.ac.kr/\n연구분야\nEUV Lithography\nNon-optical patterning\nThin Film process"
