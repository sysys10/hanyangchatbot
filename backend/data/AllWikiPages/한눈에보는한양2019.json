Among many social changes, universities are facing unprecedented challenges, and I believe only those that succeed in transforming the education paradigm will survive the fierce competition. \nHowever, such a major shift can be both a crisis and an opportunity. Since its foundation in 1939, Hanyang University has used the rapidly changing social environment as a stepping stone for opportunities.\nBy fueling the drive to change and to challenge, it is leading dynamic innovation and has become a prestigious global university.\nThe rapid development it has been leading over the past 80 years embraces the core values of Hanyang University, “Love in Deed and Truth” and “Pragmatic Academia.”\nWe will take the lead in fostering “practitioners of love in deed and truth” through education that not just any school can provide, but that which is possible because we are Hanyang. In addition, we will implement “Pragmatic Academia” to communicate with society through industry-academic education, research innovation, and advanced industry-academic cooperation. Based on this, we will ensure a sustainable and authentic future for Hanyang University.\nHanyang University, where all members are happy under the culture of empathy and communication! Please support Hanyang University as it soars to become “the best university for a better world.”\nPresident, Hanyang University\nKim Woo-seung\nHistory\n1939 Dr. Kim Lyun-joon founded Dong-A Engineering Institute in Seoul\n1948 Hanyang Engineering College is established and accredited by the government (the first private engineering college in Korea)\n1959 Hanyang Engineering College is renamed as Hanyang University\n1972 Hanyang University Medical Center is established\n1979 Ansan Campus (current ERICA Campus), the second Hanyang University campus, opened in Banwol industrial City, Gyeonggi Province\n1994 Hanyang Volunteer Corps, Korea’s first university volunteer service center is established\n2003 Education Research and Industry Cluster is established\n2008 Hanyang University Holdings, Korea’s first university technology holdings company is established\n2009 Ansan Campus is renamed as ERICA Campus\n2019 Hanyang University celebrates its 80th Anniversary in 2019.
